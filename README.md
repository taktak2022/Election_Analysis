# Election_Analysis

## Purpose and overview of project.

Module 3 had us leaning coding with Python on the Visual Studio platform.  It asks for an analysis of election information for the state of Colorado.  The information we were to obtain some election conclusions for PyPoll, mostly candidate results, followed by a breakdown by county for the PyPoll Challenge portion for this lesson.

PyPoll
1. The Total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. The total number of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

PyPoll Challenge
1. A list if the counties for this election.
2. The percentage of votes per county tabulated.
3. The total number of votes tabulated per county.
4. Determine the county that had the largest voter turnout.

## Summary and Results:

After going through the CSV file information, we determined that there were three candidates:
Charles Casper Stockham
Diana DeGette
Raymon Anthony Doane

The results of each candidate were as follows:
Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote - a total vote count of 85,213 votes.
Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote - a total vote count of 272,892 votes
Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote - a total vote count of 11,606 votes.

A total of 369,711 votes were cast.  The winner was determined to be Diana DeGette.

After retrieving the information by counties, the breakdown resulted as follows:
Jefferson tabulated 10.5% of the total votes which amounted to 38,855.
Denver tabulated 82.8% of the total votes which amounted to 306,055
and lastly Arapahoe tabulated 6.7% which amounted to 24,801 votes.
The largest turnout by county was Denver.

##Recommendation to Election Commission
This code can be further improved and possibly used for other counties of the state of Colorado.  It may well be used for other states as well.  The information could lead to improved voting practices and possible voting center locations to assist the public and registered voters in those areas.
The candidates themselves and their constituents could use it to bolster support in areas they are not favored in or focus their efforts with advertising, TV and radio ads and personal appearances in areas they are not favored to gain more of that voter base.  To get a "bigger piece of the pie" as it were.

## Analysis
Once I got the code to work, it did determine the winner and a breakdown of the information as requested, at least on the VS Code terminal.  The challenges were issues with the way the Visual Studio platform is structured and it's rules, more to the point, the information that was not provided within the module to prepare us to face these challenges.  For example, there were path errors that prevented me from retrieving the CSV information.  This was followed by the code listing the last-place candidate as the winner as well as the lowest number county.  This was not a syntax error but rather just an issue with how and where the code was indented. I was not successful in retrieving all of the same information onto the TXT file for some reason.  I will try to keep working on this issue but as of this writing, this assignment is due today so I will turn in what I have thus far.   A mention of this in class would have been helpful.  I should note, I did reach out to BCS Learning Assistants, a tutor and office hours, but none of these sources could assist with these issues.  It came down to "Google" it as the answer I received.
