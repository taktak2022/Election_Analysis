# Election_Analysis

## Purpose and overview of project.

Module 3 had us leaning coding with Python on the Visual Studio platform.  It asks for an analysis of election information for the state of Colorado.  The information we were to obtain was as follows:

1. The Total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. The total number of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Summary and Results:

After going through the CSV file information, we determined that there were three candidates:
Charles Casper Stockham
Diana DeGette
Raymon Anthony Doane

The results of each candidate were as follows:
Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote - a total vote count of 85,213 votes.
Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote - a total vote count of 272,892 votes
Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote - a total vote count of 11,606 votes.

A total of 369,711 votes were cast.  The winner was determined to be Diana DeGette.

## Analysis
Once I got the code to work, it did determine the winner and a breakdown of the information as requested.  The challenges were a issues with the way the Visual Studio platform is structured and it's rules, more to the point, the information that was not provided within the module to prepare us to face these challenges.  For example, there were path errors that prevented me from retrieving the CSV information.  This was followed by the code listing the last-place candidate was the winner.  This was not a syntax error but rather just an issue with how and where the code was indented.  A mention of this in class would have been helpful.  I should note, I did reach out to BCS Learning Assistants, a tutor and office hours, but none of these sources could assist with these issues.  It came down to "Google" it for an answer.
